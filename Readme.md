# Public Risk Perception of Microplastics in Groundwater  
*Survey Data Analysis with Python*  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This repository contains Python scripts and notebooks for analyzing survey data on public risk perception of **microplastics in groundwater**. The project aims to:  
- Explore how people perceive risks associated with microplastics.  
- Identify demographic and geographic patterns in survey responses.  
- Visualize results through clear and accessible figures.  
- Provide reproducible analysis for researchers and policymakers.  

## 📊 Data  
- **Source**: [Describe survey source, e.g., conducted by XYZ Institute in 2025].  
- **Format**: CSV/Excel/JSON (update accordingly).  
- **Variables**: demographics, awareness, concern levels, trust in institutions, etc.  

⚠️ *Note: Raw data may not be included for privacy reasons. A sample dataset or anonymized data can be provided instead.*  

## 🛠️ Requirements  
Install dependencies using:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

Key Python packages:  
- `pandas` – data manipulation  
- `numpy` – numerical analysis  
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` – visualization

## 🚀 Usage  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/microplastics-risk-perception.git
   cd microplastics-risk-perception
   ```  
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.  
3. Run analysis:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis.ipynb
   ```  

## 📈 Example Outputs  
- Distribution of risk perception scores  
- Demographic differences in concern about microplastics  
- Heatmaps and bar plots summarizing awareness levels  

## ✅ Reproducibility  
All analysis is reproducible. Ensure the dataset is available in the `data/` directory before running scripts or notebooks.  

## 📌 Future Work  
- Advanced statistical modeling (e.g., regression, factor analysis).  
- Cross-country comparisons if multi-regional data becomes available.  
- Integration with groundwater contamination measurements.
